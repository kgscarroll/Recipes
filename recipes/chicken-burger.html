    <h1>Chicken Burgers</h1>

     <p>The trick to cooking a good chicken burger is watching the cook time: they can go from juicy to bone dry quickly once overcooked. They should take about 4 to 5 minutes per side, but there are a lot of factors that lead to different cook times: whether you're cooking on a gas stove or grill, what kind of pan you're using and how well it conducts heat, and how cold your patty was when it hit the pan. Given all of these variables, we think the best way to determine doneness is by using an instant-read meat thermometer: check that the center of the burger reaches 165ºF, which is the USDA's recommended temperature for poultry.</p>
     <p>To spice things up a bit, these chicken patties are seasoned with smoked paprika and loaded with crunchy, bright coleslaw to really give beef burgers a run for their money. We then top 'em with creamy avocado slices, spicy fresh red onion, and cheddar and jalapeño before sandwiching all of it between buttery brioche buns for the ultimate bite. Serve them up along some grilled potatoes for a lighter alternative to french fries or with a bright tomato-avocado salad.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lb. ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 scallions, minced</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar</li>
        <li>4 leaves butterhead lettuce</li>
        <li>2 c. coleslaw</li>
        <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 brioche burger buns, split and lightly toasted<li>
      </ul> 
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, paprika, garlic, and green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add burger patties and cook, flipping once, until golden and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 165°, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with cheddar, cover, and cook until just melted, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer patties to a plate. </li>
        <li>Stack lettuce, coleslaw, chicken burgers, avocado, red onion, jalapeño, and more coleslaw on top of bottom buns. Close sandwiches with top buns.</li>
