    <p>Butter Paneer Masala, also often called Shahi Paneer or Paneer Makhani, is simply the vegetarian version of Indiaâ€™s cult classic Butter Chicken. Most Indian restaurants even use the same rich, creamy tomato-y sauce for both dishes (Butter Paneer and Butter Chicken). This easy butter paneer recipe is seriously one of the best and truly a favourite in our home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tsp coarse salt</li>
        <li>2 cups diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>400 grams paneer cut in cubes</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro and sliced optional, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter over medium heat in a large saucepan or dutch oven. Add onions and slowly cook until golden, about 20 minutes, reducing heat if they are getting crispy or browning quickly. This is an important flavour-building step, don't rush it!</li>
        <li>Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in garam masala, paprika, cinnamon and salt; cook 1 minute more. Add tomatoes and almonds; cook 2 minutes, then add cream and carefully puree using an immersion blender (or standing blender, but do it in batches or the steam will blow the top off).</li>
        <li>Return sauce to saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Gently stir in paneer and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Top with cilantro and additional almonds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
